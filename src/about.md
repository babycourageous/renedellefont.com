# About this Starter Template

This is a quick way to get started with [11ty](https://11ty.io) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com). The project currently supports all of Netlify's functionality through the Netlify CLI and Netlify Dev. Hopefully soon I'll get around to adding a starting point for Netlify CMS as well.

This site is hosted on Netlify!

Deploy Status: [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/056b4a67-70e6-4af4-9be5-dee151b8e906/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/11ty-netlify-starter/deploys)

The quickest way to your own instance of this starter project is to click the **Deploy To Netlify** button below and then just follow the instructions.

</div>

When you click the Deploy To Netlify button, Netlify will clone this 11ty Netlify Starter git repository into your personal Github account (you will have to allow permissions for it to add the repo for you). A new site will then be created for you in Netlify and it will be configured to use your new repo. You will then immediately be able to deploy changes by pushing changes to your repo.
